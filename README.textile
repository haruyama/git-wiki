h2. What is different in this fork?

* more likely to be a bit minimalistic or 'pure' than chock-full of features (no bloat)
* html5, no time spent on supporting old browsers
* case-insensitive searching. This makes a lot of sense for a wiki, doesn't it?
* minimal design
* gravatars in page history
* the top bar is partly a self-hosted wiki page
* attachments might not work :-/
* improved recognition for urls
* usable on mobile browsers (iphone/android)
* use updated or different gems for more extensive markdown-support. (a.o. tables)
* no javascript used at this time. (might change in the future)
